    <h1>Chicken Pad Thai:</h1>
    <img src="./images/padthai.jpg" >
    <h2>Description</h2>    
    <p>Pad Thai is a popular street food dish that’s served all over Thailand. It typically features rice noodles, bean sprouts, peanuts, scrambled egg, and a source of protein (I’ve heard that shrimp is most common in Thailand).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flat Rice Noodles</li>
        <li>Coconut oil</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Cook rice noodles according to package directions, drain, rinse under cold water; set aside.</li>
    <li>To a very large skillet at least 4 inches deep, add the oils (vegetable and/or olive oil may be substituted for the sesame and coconut oil), onion, and sauté the onion over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, or until onion is beginning to soften; stir intermittently.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken and cook for about 3 minutes, or until done; stir and flip nearly constantly to ensure even cooking. The chicken will cook very quickly if it's sliced sufficiently thin.</li>
    <li> the garlic, ginger, and cook for about 1 minute, or until fragrant; stir nearly constantly. </li>
    <li>Add the cabbage, carrots, soy sauce, fish sauce, lime juice, stir to combine, cover skillet with a lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for about 3 minutes, or until cabbage wilts and softens. Remove lid and stir.<li>
    <li>Add the honey and stir to combine.</li>

    </ol>
